# Version Matrix & Upgrade Log

> Governing rule (CLAUDE.md): **mutual compatibility first, then newest.** All versions are
> pinned in lockfiles; no open ranges (`^`/`~`) for critical packages. Upgrades happen as one
> tested wave, between phases only. Every upgrade is recorded here with its rationale.

## Approved matrix (from CLAUDE.md v1.1 — verified & pinned at project start)

### Runtime

| Package | Target | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Node.js | 22 LTS | Next.js 16 requires Node 20+. |
| Python | 3.12 | Stable across the full dependency chain. |

### Frontend

| Package | Target |
|---|---|
| Next.js | 16.x (App Router, Turbopack default) |
| React | 19.x |
| TypeScript | 5.x (strict) |
| Tailwind CSS | 4.x |
| shadcn/ui | latest compatible with Tailwind 4 |
| Zustand | 5.x |
| TanStack Query | 5.x |
| React Hook Form + Zod | latest stable |
| Recharts | latest stable |

### Desktop

| Package | Target |
|---|---|
| Electron | latest stable line (>=33), pinned after verification |
| electron-builder | compatible with the pinned Electron line |

### Backend

| Package | Target |
|---|---|
| FastAPI | >=0.115 (Pydantic v2 compatible) |
| SQLAlchemy | 2.0 (async) |
| Pydantic | v2 |
| Celery | 5.x |
| WeasyPrint | latest stable (A4/A5 reports only) |
| python-barcode + GS1 DataMatrix parser | latest stable |

### Database / infra

| Package | Target |
|---|---|
| PostgreSQL | 17 (local Docker; must match the Supabase project major) |
| Supabase CLI | latest stable |
| Redis | 7.x |

Migrations: SQL via Supabase CLI only (`supabase/migrations/`). No Alembic — SQLAlchemy models
mirror the schema, they are not its source.

## Toolchain pins provisionally applied in P0-M1 (root devDependencies)

These are the dev toolchain pins committed in `package.json`. Per the version policy, the first
`pnpm install` on a networked machine is the **verification gate**: it resolves the lockfile and,
where a newer compatible stable exists, the pin is bumped as one wave and recorded below.

| Package | Provisional pin |
|---|---|
| typescript | 5.7.2 |
| turbo | 2.3.3 |
| eslint / @eslint/js | 9.17.0 |
| typescript-eslint | 8.18.1 |
| prettier | 3.4.2 |
| husky | 9.1.7 |
| lint-staged | 15.2.11 |
| @commitlint/cli | 19.6.1 |
| @commitlint/config-conventional | 19.6.0 |

## Environment reconciliation (open — tracked under decision D0)

The current authoring sandbox differs from the pinned targets and must be reconciled where Phase 0
is actually built/verified:

| Item | Target | Sandbox | Action |
|---|---|---|---|
| Node.js | 22 LTS | 24.x | CI pins Node 22; `.nvmrc` = 22. |
| Python | 3.12 | 3.9 | Provision 3.12 on the build/verify machine. |
| Docker + Compose | required | absent | DB-dependent steps run on a Docker-enabled machine/CI. |
| PostgreSQL / Redis | 17 / 7 | absent | Provided via Docker Compose (P0-M2). |
| Supabase CLI | latest | absent | Installed on the build/verify machine (P0-M3). |
| Package registries | reachable | egress restricted | Allowlist required before `pnpm install`. |

## Python pins — resolved & verified on Python 3.12.13 / PostgreSQL 17.8 (2026-07)

Installed, tested (24 tests green incl. live login + backup/restore drill), and pinned in
`apps/api/pyproject.toml`: fastapi 0.139.0 · uvicorn 0.51.0 · sqlalchemy 2.0.51 ·
asyncpg 0.31.0 · pydantic 2.13.4 · pydantic-settings 2.14.2 · argon2-cffi 25.1.0 ·
PyJWT 2.13.0 · cryptography 49.0.0 · keyring 25.7.0 · celery 5.6.3 · redis 8.0.1 ·
httpx 0.28.1 · pytest 9.1.1 · pytest-asyncio 1.4.0 · ruff 0.15.21 · black 26.5.1 · mypy 2.2.0.
All satisfy the CLAUDE.md matrix (FastAPI ≥0.115 / Pydantic v2 / SQLAlchemy 2.0 async).

## JS pins — RESOLVED & verified (2026-07, first networked install, P1-M2)

`pnpm install` succeeded once `registry.npmjs.org` was allowlisted; `pnpm-lock.yaml` is committed
(the version-policy gate). Verified by `pnpm typecheck` (shared/ui/web) + a clean **Next.js 16
production build** of apps/web.

next 16.0.0 · react/react-dom 19.0.0 · tailwindcss + @tailwindcss/postcss 4.3.2 · zustand 5.0.0 ·
@tanstack/react-query 5.59.0 · react-hook-form 7.53.0 · zod 3.23.8 · @hookform/resolvers 3.9.1 ·
@fontsource-variable/cairo 5.2.7 · @fontsource-variable/inter 5.2.8 · typescript 5.7.2 ·
eslint 9.17.0 · typescript-eslint 8.18.1 · prettier 3.4.2 · turbo 2.3.3.

Wave adjustments at this gate (compatibility-first, then newest):
- **tailwindcss / @tailwindcss/postcss 4.0.0 → 4.3.2**: 4.0.0's oxide scanner is incompatible with
  Next 16 Turbopack (`Missing field 'negated' on ScannerOptions.sources`); 4.3.2 builds clean.
- **Fonts: next/font/google → self-hosted @fontsource-variable (Cairo + Inter)**: Google Fonts is
  fetched at build time, breaking offline/reproducible builds (CLAUDE.md offline-first). Self-hosting
  the same design-system fonts removes the build- and run-time Google dependency.
- Dropped `erasableSyntaxOnly` from packages/shared tsconfig (needs TS 5.8; pinned TS is 5.7). Strip
  safety stays enforced at runtime by the RBAC generator running under Node type-stripping.

## Upgrade log

- **2026-07 — Initial matrix (v1.1).** Adopted the CLAUDE.md v1.1 matrix as the project baseline.
  Provisional JS toolchain pins committed in P0-M1 (validation gate: first networked install).
  Python matrix resolved, installed and verified against PostgreSQL 17.8 in P0-M6..M9.
